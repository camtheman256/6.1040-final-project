# final-project

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

[Open API Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## MongoDB Atlas setup

[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com)

After following the instructions above, you should have copied a secret that looks something like `mongodb+srv://xxxxxx:xxxxxxxxx@cluster0.yc2imit.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`. Note that this allows complete access to your database, so do not include it anywhere that is pushed to GitHub or any other publicly accessible location.

To allow your local server to connect to the database you just created, create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory with the contents

```
MONGO_SRV=mongodb+srv://xxxxxx:xxxxxxxxx@cluster0.yc2imit.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

where the secret is replaced with the one you obtained.
